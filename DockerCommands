Docker Commands
================


Run a container:

docker run <container name>

excamples :


docker run busybox

docker run hello-world

docker run redis

See all running containers:

docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
d285cd302ccb        redis               "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   6 seconds ago       Up 2 seconds        6379/tcp            boring_easley

If you do not have any containers to run it will be like:

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES


Now if you want to run a command inside to your runing container you need :

1 )
docker ps
see the Container ID for excample --> ( d285cd302ccb )

2 )
docker exec #command
++++++++++++++++++++

 -i -t < your Containes ID  > the command you want to execute

-it        d285cd302ccb                  redis-cli / ls / ls -l

The command:

docker exec -it d285cd302ccb  redis-cli


3 ) If you want to go in to containers environment:

docker exec -it 39819566116e sh

Ths command is like before but now we include the sh

Now you are into the containers terminal.
Is an linux environment.
So you can exec every commmand you exec on linux.

Like :
ls / ls -l / echo "" / cat / cd / mkdir ect,ect.....

Now if you want to build your oun image:


1 )

# Create a file

mkdir xxxx

2 )

cd xxxx

3 )

# Cteate an file with name Dockerfile

4 )

# Use your text edditor

vim Dockerfile

5 )

Now lets build our first docker image:
Put all of these into your docker file --> Dockerfile

# Use an existing docker image as a base
FROM alpine



# Download and insall a dependency
RUN apk add --update redis



# Tell the image what to do when is starts
# as a container
CMD ["redis-server"]

It will run the redis server but it is a first step.

6 ) 

# Build docker image now.
Exec the command: 

docker build .

=========================================

Dockerfile --> Docker Client --> Docker Server --> Usable Image!

In step 1/3
You insall the apline. As our first image.

In step 2/3
1 ) Create a container from the first image -->  8d4585b5a560
    ( Running in 8d4585b5a560 )
2 ) Install redisinside the container
3 ) Remove the container 8d4585b5a560 and in the first image install the new changes 
    into a new name image 2c2d15302475.
    So now we have a new image with apline and redis installed.

In stap 3/3
1 ) Create a new container 2335c50f18d3 in these container will specify
    which will be the Startup Command for our Image --> redis-server  
2 ) Remove the container 2335c50f18d3 and create a new one image --> 490e8c783419
    where will be update the older image with the new Startup Command.

7 )

# Run your image.
# Go at the last line fron the output of the last command.
# See the image ID.
# Copy.
# Run the command.

docker run < your image ID >

Example:
           # look the last line on 6th step. ( Successfully built 490e8c783419 )

docker run 490e8c783419
